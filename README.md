# AsyncSpawnMob
ah yes, welcome.

## How does it work?
Instead of spawning every monster at more or less the same time, just like other plugins do it, mine spawns the monsters delayed divided in different tasks in smaller amounts to reduce the performance load.
This works not programmly asynchronous, but it fulfills the definition of asynchronous.
